/** 
 * A Queue implementation which operates in amortized O(1).
 * `isEmpty`, `head` and `tail` are originally O(1).
 * And `:+` can be regarted as amortized O(1) by baker's method.  
 * When `:+` is called save up 1 credit in addition to the original cost (so amortized cost should be 2), 
 * and use that credit when `rear.reverse` occurred.
